# Off The Beaten Track
TechUp 2024 - Travel Recommender Web App

Problem statement: We love seeing the world... but travel planning is hard. There's just too many places to visit and too little time to do so. Studies have shown that we spend an average of 5 hours consuming online travel content before deciding where to go. And while most travel websites offer generic lists, they often lack customised options, e.g. search and filtering by budget, traveller type and climate. Navigating through this sea of choices can be discouraging and time-consuming.

Proposed Solution: Introducing a web app that offers personalized recommendations based on user-defined keywords and filters - inspiring new travel destinations, saving time, and reducing the initial stressors/barriers associated with travel planning.
